"""Drives scripts/publish-github-release.sh against a stubbed `gh`.

`deploy` is main-only — by `if:` and by `environment: production` — so its
steps never execute on a pull request, and the release-publishing logic could
otherwise only be verified by merging it. That logic has several branches that
matter precisely when something has already gone wrong (an interrupted create,
a half-uploaded asset), which is the worst place to find a mistake. So each
branch is exercised here: a throwaway git repository supplies the commit count,
a stub `gh` on PATH records what it was called with, and the assertions pin
both the commands and their order.

The ordering assertions are the point, not decoration. A release must never
become visible without its bundle, so every path that uploads must upload
before it publishes.

Standard library only, matching the other scripts in this directory. Run it
directly: python3 scripts/publish_github_release_test.py
