"""Drives the release-notes subject collection from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

`deploy` is main-only, so the "Build release notes" step never runs on a pull
request and a regression in it would first surface after reaching `main` — as a
wrong Play "What's new" card, which is the worst place to find one.

The whole collection block is extracted from the workflow and run against a
throwaway git repository, rather than a copy of the helper being tested in
isolation. Two reasons, both about what a test like this gets wrong: a copy
passes forever once the workflow drifts, and exercising only the helper would
stay green if the loop stopped calling it — putting the duplicate bullets
straight back while every assertion still reported ok.

Standard library only, matching the other scripts in this directory — no YAML
parser, so the block is located by its own source. Run it directly:
