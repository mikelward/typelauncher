# The docs lane: lets housekeeping-only pull requests merge without the
# heavy jobs, while one required check — the `gate` job — still reports on
# every PR.
#
# Why this exists: a ruleset can only require named checks, and a required
# check that never reports blocks the PR forever. A `paths:` filter on
# `pull_request` skips the whole workflow for housekeeping diffs, which is
# exactly that trap. So the workflow runs on every PR; `classify` decides
# whether the heavy jobs may skip, and `gate` — the only job a ruleset should
# require — independently re-derives that decision before blessing a skip, so
# a classification bug turns into a red check instead of a silent merge.
#
# One source of truth: both jobs run THIS file, so the housekeeping rule
# cannot drift between them. What the gate adds is re-execution plus a
# cross-check against what actually ran. scripts/docs-lane.test.sh exercises
# every branch below against a stubbed `gh`, and the classify job runs it
# before classifying — a broken rule fails closed, never green.
#
# This file is shared across the sibling repos (first landed in snoozemo,
# hardened by eight review rounds there). Everything below the config
# section is the ENGINE and stays identical everywhere; when you change it,
# change it in every repo that carries it.

# linked from the About dialog and ships as a release-notes bullet, so its
# commits are legitimately bare-subject and belong on the code lane; and
# anything under app/ is a build input whatever its extension (a packaged
# asset or resource can be markdown). Everything else is code — including
# .gitignore, because the screenshot job's refresh step `git add`s recorded
# snapshots, and an ignore rule can silently stop that add while the lane
# skips the very job that would notice.
