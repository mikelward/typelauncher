# Firebase App Distribution

CI distributes internal builds to testers through Firebase App Distribution. The upload is wired into the `build` job in `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` using `wzieba/Firebase-Distribution-Github-Action@v1`. There is no Gradle plugin involved.

## What gets uploaded

The action uploads the **debug** APK that `assembleDebug` already produced (`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`). Distributing the debug APK avoids configuring a release signing keystore at this stage; debug-signed builds remain installable for internal testers.

## Stable debug signing key

Android refuses to install an APK as an update of an existing one if the signing key has changed. By default, every CI runner generates a fresh `~/.android/debug.keystore`, so successive FAD builds would force testers to uninstall before re-installing. To keep the signature stable, CI materializes a debug keystore from a repository secret and points `app/build.gradle.kts`'s `signingConfigs.debug` at it via the `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_FILE` environment variable. The keystore is **not** checked in (this is a public repo), and local builds without the env vars set fall through to AGP's auto-generated debug keystore so day-to-day development keeps working.

To generate the keystore once:

```sh
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
keytool -genkeypair \
  -keystore debug.keystore \
  -alias androiddebugkey \
  -storetype PKCS12 \
  -storepass "$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" \
  -keypass "$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" \
  -dname "CN=Type Launcher Debug, O=Type Launcher, C=US" \
  -validity 36500 \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048
base64 -w0 debug.keystore > debug.keystore.b64
echo "Password: $KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
```

Then save the base64 contents and password into the secrets below and **delete the local keystore file** (`*.keystore` is gitignored, but don't tempt fate). PKCS12 stores share a single password between the store and the key, so `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `DEBUG_KEY_PASSWORD` should both be set to the same value.

## When the upload runs

The upload step is gated so it only runs when all of the following are true:

- The triggering event is a `push` to `refs/heads/main`. PRs and feature pushes don't ship to testers.
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID` is non-empty.
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` is non-empty.
- `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_BASE64` is non-empty — an APK signed with the runner's throwaway debug key would force testers to uninstall before installing (signature mismatch), so distribution skips rather than ship one.

Forks and fresh clones without Firebase secrets configured still get a green CI run — the step is silently skipped.

## Required GitHub secrets

| Secret | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Firebase App ID for the Android app, e.g. `1:1234567890:android:abcdef`. |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Full JSON content of a service account that has the `Firebase App Distribution Admin` role. |
| `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded PKCS12 keystore bytes (`base64 -w0 debug.keystore`). |
| `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Random hex string set when the keystore was generated. |
| `DEBUG_KEY_PASSWORD` | Same value as `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` (PKCS12 convention). |
| `DEBUG_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias inside the keystore. Use `androiddebugkey` to match AGP's default. |

## Tester group

The tester group is hard-coded as `testers` in the workflow. The group with this name must exist in the Firebase App Distribution console. To rename it, update both the console and the `groups:` value in `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` together.

## Release notes

Release notes default to the head commit message followed by the run number and full SHA:

```
<commit subject>
<commit body, if any>
---
Build: <run-number> · <sha>
```

The first ~60 characters of these notes appear in the tester device's push notification, so keep commit subjects informative.

## Manual upload from a workstation

Install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) and run:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug
firebase appdistribution:distribute app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk \
  --app "$FIREBASE_APP_ID" \
  --groups testers \
  --release-notes "Local upload from $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
```
